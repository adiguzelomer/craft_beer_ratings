Last year OCEARCH was invited to speak on Nantucket and the interest that ensued by both locals and tourists was unbelievable. 

The first steps were deciding on the beer, then the package and then the bait to get people to bite at retail. After sampling several styles of beer, the consensus was that a light lager would be best. Something you could enjoy on a boat or the beach, while fishing with your buddies. Samples of 4 styles of beer were shipped out to the key decision makers.

Cisco brought on HP's Aurasma software who will be powering the can. Through augmented reality, each can of Shark Tracker will allow the consumer to scan the logo on the can after downloading the OCEARCH Shark tracker app.
Updates from the OCEARCH crew and exclusive video content as well as shark locations can all be viewed through your phone. 
The first round of the these cans are already committed and retailers should see them throughout Mass in July & just in time for Shark Week in August. ""Fisch""and Berger of OCEARCH along with Jay Harman of Cisco Brewers see global potential for this brand and are already working on an international & multilingual can that can be distributed as OCEARCH plans their next expedition.",16.82,44806.0,3.21,34.0,5.0,american light lager,0.0,0.0,cisco brewers inc. shark tracker light lager

He moved a house, midwinter, with horses from North Greensboro to Greensboro Village and also helped build the first road from Greensboro to Greensboro Bend.

I spent more than 6 years contemplating such a beer that might be worthy of Samuel's name. In an attempt to honor this intrepid relative, I realized that his namesake beer must be comprised of the same nuances that defined two of my favorite beers: Le Sarrasin and Vera Mae. We set out by crafting a base of buckwheat, spelt, Vermont wildflower honey, and the same hops used in both Vera and Sarrasin.

The beer has four extravagant adjuncts: Geisha Coffee, Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans, Cacao Nibs from Ghana, and a very large amount of hazelnuts. These ingredients were quite expensive, hence the bottle price, but I tried to keep the cost as similar to Grasp as possible, even though I used the same adjunct ratio as Grasp for the coffee, but even more hazelnuts, even more cacao than I used in Territory, and the same amount of vanilla that was in Beans. This stout was boiled for about eight hours to achieve an even thicker, more viscous base for these adjuncts. The result is a Stout with a huge hazelnut and milk chocolate aroma and flavor. There are also notes of light coffee, brownie batter, fudge, marshmallow, caramel, and butterscotch. The vanilla makes it very creamy without using any lactose, making this the most “pastry” of the Stouts I have released yet and definitely the most adjunct-fueled.",5.4,,4.63,61.0,9.0,american imperial stout,0.0,15.0,horus aged ales proper dose

Also the aroma delights the connoisseur: soft roasted accents and a nuance of dried fruit carrying a vein of caramel. This Doppelbock Dunkel from Bavaria’s Holy Mountain presents a pleasant effervescence. And then there’s the unmistakable flavour: mouthcoating and velvety, strong and yet pleasantly malty – a powerful, robust body. At the same time, it develops an easily recognisable sweetness, embraced in roasted cocoa and a light, bitter hoppiness.

Concluding with a powerful punch, this Doppelbock departs with a lingering aftertaste of quality plain chocolate.

Copper-colored, full-flavored and well-hopped, Anaheim 1888 is our flagship beer.

The beer is aptly named to reflect the glory days of the original Anaheim Brewery. It was in 1888 when Friedrich Conrad, our spiritual forefather, began construction on a vast brick building on West Broadway to house the expanded brewery.

The Anaheim Gazette noted in 1890 that Conrad's beer ""appears to be fully equal if not superior to the celebrated Anheuser beer of St. Louis. Besides it is a strictly Orange County product and all who are in the habit of using beer should give it a trial if only to encourage home industries.""

The culmination of all our Street beers over the past 6 years, The Streets is a Triple IPA brewed to celebrate our anniversary. Using the same base recipe and bumping the ABV up to 10.6%, we dry hopped with Amarillo, Mosaic, Galaxy, El Dorado, Simcoe, Nelson, Vic Secret, & Enigma. Additionally, as a nod to the neighborhood, we also added Citra to the dry hop this year, the signature hop used for our Fort Point Pale Ale

Heavily hazy and orange in appearance, The Street offers a nose rich with aromas of candied peach, tropical fruit, lime zest, pineapple and melon rind.

Schwarzbier is to lager what stout or porter is to ale. Like those dark British beers, Schwarzbier has long been considered nourishing and even curative. German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.

We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with noble hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.

This German lager pours a deep brown, almost black color with ruby highlights. It has soft dark chocolate notes with hints of caramel and a light roasty finish.
